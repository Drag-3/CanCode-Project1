# Prompt

>Collect three sets of data from the user. Each set of data should be more than
three pieces of data long. You should collect the pieces of data one at a time.
Each set of data should be one type of data i.e. strings, numbers, boolean. Find
the mean, median, mode, total for each set of data, you can skip ones that don't
apply to that type of data. Be sure to make it so the user can enter a number
with a decimal like 10.5. There are a number of ways you can accomplish this.
Keep in mind the userâ€™s experience when entering data.

# Examples

Set 1 user enters the values: `[12, 3.5, hello, True, 7, 10]`  
After filtering set 1 should be: `[12, 3.5, 7, 10]`  
Mean: `8.125`  
Median: `8.5`  
Mode: `None`  
Total: `32.5`   

Set 2 user enters the values: `[hello, bye, hello, hello, cat, dog, danger, True, 13]`  
After filtering set 2 should be: `[hello, bye, hello, hello, cat, dog, danger]` 

Mean: `NA`  
Median: `dog`  
Mode: `hello`  
Total: `hellobyehellohellocatdogdanger`  

Set 3 user enters that values: `[True, cat, False, True, 10.5, False, True]`  
After filtering set 3 should be: `[True, False, True, False, True]`  

Mean: `NA`  
Median: `NA`  
Mode: `True`  
Total: `NA`
